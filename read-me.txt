The employee portal contains the REST services made using Spring Boot, and the front-end consists of Angular JS

The REST service:
*It uses Spring Boot, MVC design pattern, and an HSQL embeded database, also it uses JDBC to connect to it.
*The whole thing is deployed on Apache Tomcat
*To access the HSQL database, you can go to http://localhost:8080/h2, username is root, and passoword is root
*Just run the application to start the rest service

Front-END:
*It consists of 2 modules: User Module and Employee Module
*The User module has 4 components including home,login and register
*The Employee module has 2 components including employee-display-all and emp-display
*The user-routing-module routes all paths to the app.module

Connection:
*The front-end is connected with the rest service using a CORS configuration file in Java
*Also the node server is started with a proxy.config file which makes it listen to the target port

To start:
just go to the directory and run this command in cmd:
java -jar target\employee_portal-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
This will start the REST services

Now do a npm install for front-end, and then npm start with run the angular

Not you can just go to http://localhost:4200/ to run the application
